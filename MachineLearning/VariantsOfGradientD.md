# Variants of Gradient Descent

In [Gradient Descent](GradientDescent.md)we saw what it is, how it works, requirements, problems, among other things. Now we'll take a look in the variants of this algorithm and what is each one for.

- **Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (mBGD)**
