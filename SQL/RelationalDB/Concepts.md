## Relational DataBases

In a hierarchical or network database, the application relies on a defined implementation of that database, which is then hard-coded into the application. If you add  a new attribute (data item) to the database, you must modify the application, even if it  doesnâ€™t use the attribute. However, a relational database is independent of the application;  you can make non-destructive modifications to the structure without impacting the application. In addition, the structure of the relational database is based on the relation, or table, along with the ability to define complex relationships between these relations. Each relation can be accessed directly, without the cumbersome limitations of a hierarchical or owner/member model that requires navigation of a complex data structure.
